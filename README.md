### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
To initiate the player, run the mainPlayer.java file
To initiate the builder, run the mainBuilder.java file

* Configuration:
The two main methods are in two main classes in the lettercraze package. There is one java project for everything. The program should work fine on Mac, Windows 10 and Linux.

* Dependencies
Through a collective oversight, most of the builder had to be redone, as it did not follow EBC

* Database configuration:
All the level files are stored in the resources folder. Note that they use base 0 indexing

* How to run tests:
Run the "Test" folder as JUnit tests. JUnit 3 was used.
